1. Use of Context?
	Context is used in React to share data between components without prop drilling, 
	creating a global state accessible to all nested components within a tree.

2. useContext and useReducer
	useContext-The useContext Hook provides function components access to the context value for a context object.
	useReducer-The useReducer Hook is used to store and update states

3. How to update state in context?
	 To update state in context, use the `useState` hook within the context provider component and provide a function to update the state.	

4. What is createcontext?write it purpose
	`createContext` is a function in React used to create a context object, 
	which helps in sharing state and data across components efficiently.

5. context.Provider and context.consumer?
	Context allows components to access shared data, the provider sets the context's value,
	and the consumer consumes it within nested components.

6. Difference between redux and context
	Redux is a state management library, while Context is a feature in React for sharing state locally. 
	Redux is more suitable for complex applications.

7.Purpose of useSelector and useDispatch
	useSelector - is for accessing specific parts of Redux store state, and 
	useDispatch - is used to dispatch actions in React Redux.


8. Use of fragment 
	Fragments in React allow grouping multiple elements without introducing extra parent divs in the DOM.

9. What is store in redux 
	In Redux, a store is a centralized place to store application state.

10. How to read initial state and reducer funvtion in redux
	Initial state is defined when creating a Redux store, 
	and the reducer function specifies how state changes in response to actions.

11. What is scss and uses
	SCSS is a superset of CSS that adds features like variables and nesting for more maintainable and organized styles. 

12. Differentiate between scss and css 
	SCSS is a preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables and nesting, making stylesheets more modular and maintainable compared to traditional CSS.

13. Why use go for lifecycle
	Lifecycle methods in React allow you to perform actions at specific stages of a component's life, like componentDidMount for initial setup.

14. Which one is better redux or context ?give Reason 
	The choice between Redux and Context depends on the project's complexity; Redux is better for larger, more complex applications, while Context is simpler and suitable for smaller ones.

15. How many slice created in redux and how many store in redux
	Redux can have multiple slices for different parts of the state, but typically, there's one store for the entire application.
